## RedefiningNü: Chinese Characters with Female Radicals

RedefiningNü is an innovative initiative aimed at challenging and redefining the perceptions associated with Chinese characters containing the "woman" radical (女). In Chinese, many characters with this radical have historically carried negative connotations, often reflecting societal biases and stereotypes against women.


### SEEK TO

1. Explore the etymology and historical context of these characters.
2. Highlight positive characters with the female radical that are often overlooked.
3. Propose alternative interpretations or uses that empower rather than diminish.
4. Raise awareness about linguistic sexism in Chinese characters.

RedefiningNü aims to foster a more inclusive and equitable understanding of Chinese language and culture. We believe that by reclaiming and reframing these characters, we can contribute to broader conversations about gender equality and linguistic evolution.
